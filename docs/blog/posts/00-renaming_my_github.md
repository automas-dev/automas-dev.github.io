# Changing My GitHub Username

It's been a long time coming, but I've finally renamed my GitHub account. Since
I made the account in 2013, through my entire undergraduate degree in computer
science and my entire professional life, I've used a not so creative username
from my community college email that I had at the time.

<!-- more -->

The community college provided each student with an email address starting with
their 3 (or 2) initials followed by 4 random numbers[^1]. I haven't always been
a super creative person, so when I enrolled at Virginia Tech, I used the same
id.

    Github private wasn't free in 2015

    My university email provided free private repos through the student account.

    On [January 7, 2019](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/new-year-new-github/),
    GitHub announced it's new unlimited private repos.

    At the time of
    renaming `2025-04-05`, I have 110 repositories, 71 of which are public.

## Why would you do this?

Great question. It is a fair point that I have so many repos now that span
across many projects, computers and services I've developed over the years, but
takeing another perspective, this is the perfect time, because I will only keep
growing my repos, and renaming will become more and more tedious or down right
impossible.

Also, this just gives me a chance to claim another username in my quest to
become the automas. Sadly, `automas` is already taken, and so `automas.net`, but
this gave me a great change to unify my github username with the website domain.
I registered [automas.dev](https://automas.dev/) to continue this new _brand_.
